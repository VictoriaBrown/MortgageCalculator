# MortgageCalculator
Mortgage Calculator - Calculate the monthly payments of a fixed term mortgage over given Nth terms at a given interest rate. Also figure out how long it will take the user to pay back the loan. For added complexity, I will be adding an option for users to select the compounding interval (Monthly, Weekly, Daily, Continually).


I will be completing this exercise in the following programming languages:
  * Java
  * C++
  * Python
  * C#
